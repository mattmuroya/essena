                “As readers we push at arguments, testing the expressed and articulating the submerged assumptions of fact, definition, or value in order to accept or reject them. That is what it means to be sensitive to language in argument: to be aware of facts that are assumed significant, to notice definitions that might be slippery or inadequate, to pick out values that might be implicit in word choice and metaphor.”

            <p>If you’ve used social media in the past several weeks, you’ve probably seen this video:</p>

            <br>

            <p>
                <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/145100063" width="100%" height="450px" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>The girl is 19-year-old Essena O’Neill, a (former) self-made social media model and icon. She’d made for herself a considerable career posting photos of herself on Instagram, making videos on YouTube, and posting to Tumblr, Snapchat, and other social media outlets. With over half a million Instagram followers and hundreds of thousands of YouTube views, she’d “made it” according to so-called standards of society.</p>

            <p>But several weeks ago, the internet experienced a wave of outspoken, tear-filled, emotional outpourings from Essena, who decided to come clean about her life behind all the photos and social media fame. In a <a href="https://vimeo.com/145100063">video</a> originally posted to YouTube, she decried the “fake” and “dangerous” nature of social media and the negative effect it’s had on her life and personal well-being. She said:</p>

            <p>"I'm the girl who had it all and I want to tell you that having it all on social media means absolutely nothing to your real life. Everything I was doing was edited and contrived and to get more views ... Everything I did was for views, for likes, for followers."</p>

            <p>In response to her realization of the alleged detrimental nature of social media, she has publicly denounced all of its forms and has turned her attention to a new online effort:</p>

            <p align=center><a href="http://www.letsbegamechangers.com">www.letsbegamechangers.com</a></p>

            <p>Let’s Be Game Changers is Essena’s new online presence: a website where she can express her new outlook.</p>

            <p>“This movement is something so much bigger than myself. What I’m doing here is a statement that real life isn’t through a screen. I’m not against social sharing; I’m against the current status of social media.”</p>

            <p>So what does the site aim to do? Who is Essena talking to and what is her message and goal? And most importantly, does she accomplish what she set out to do? Let’s explore it.</p>

            <p><em>Note: I am aware that many people have criticized the irony of Essena’s movement against social media since it relies on social media to spread. Chances are, the reason you’ve probably heard the story before is that someone you know posted it on social media. In fact, many people (including some of her <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/11/04/essena-oneill-hoax_n_8474476.html">personal friends</a>) have taken to the internet to claim that Essena is a “fake” and a “hoax” and that her anti-social media statement is yet another publicity stunt. While I cannot deny this distinct possibility, commentary on whether her intentions are genuine could merit an entirely seperate discussion beyond the scope of objective rhetorical analysis.</em></p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>In the second century BC, Hermagoras conceived a method of rhetorical categorization of recurrent questions of contention into different stases, now commonly referred to now as Stasis Theory. Originally developed for court of law, Stasis Theory has since been expounded upon in detail by Cicero, Quintillian, and Hermogenes. Application of the stases to matters outside the courtroom has proven to be a particularly valuable probe for audience and context analysis, as demonstrated by Jeanne Fahnstock and Marie Secor (431).</p>

            <p>Stasis Theory outlines four different stases, or “states” of argumentation by which we categorize questions about a particular subject or events. These stases are as follows:</p>
<ul>
            <li><strong>Conjecture-</strong> The facts of the matter; whether something veritably happened, whether there is an issue, and in certain cases, the cause of the issue.</li>

            <li><strong>Definition-</strong> The nature of the issue; what the issue is and how it is characterized, and what the larger class of things/events the belongs to is.</li>

            <li><strong>Quality-</strong> The analysis and implication of the issue; whether it is good or bad, how serious it is, whom it might affect, and what the impending reactions to the issue are.</li>

            <li><strong>Policy-</strong> The proposed action to address the issue; what needs to happen to solve the problem.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Stasis Theory is a tiered method of investigation. That is, each state must be fully established before the next may be considered: "Questions of fact or conjecture in the first stasis are prior to those of definition in the second; definitions in turn must be established before the quality is debated; and finally all three must be answered or assumed before an action can be recommended or taken in a specific case” (135). So, in order to make a policy claim, the rhetor must first establish the facts, definition, and analysis of the issue.</p>

            <p>However, the effectiveness of a rhetor’s argument often depends heavily on her attention to audience and her understanding of their values within a particular context. In a later article, Fahnstock and Secor reveal that a rhetor might stall in one or two of the stasis and allow the values of the audience and the context of exigence to fill lead the rest of the argument. They write:</p>

            <p>“The great template of the stases hovers above whatever piece of writing we are actually looking at; the stases represent a full set of possibilities from which an author, in a particular rhetorical situation, under a particular exigence, addressing a particular audience, selects. The author may stay in just one or two of the stases because that is where he or she can meet the intended audience, because that is where the audience’s needs and interests lie, or because that is where they can be reached, no matter where the writer wants to take them. In other words, the stases are not only an invention device and a principle of arrangement; they can also become a sensitive tool of audience analysis” (430-1).</p>
                
                <p>I will use this basis to examine the audience that Essena O’Neill has constructed and determine whether her site’s rhetoric appropriately addresses the issue.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>To begin, let’s look at the aim of Essena’s site. The fourth stasis of policy is clear; the title of the site itself (ignoring is blatant disregard for proper punctuation) is a call to action:</p>
            

<img src="assets/images/logo.jpg">

            <p>Essena is addressing her audience, asking them to be “game changers.” But who is her audience? What does it mean? What is the problem, and how is it being addressed? How did she get to the fourth stasis? To answer that question, let’s analyze the website’s primary claim and call to action:</p>
            

            <p>“I'm over all the mainstream distractions that cloud our lives - celebrity culture, hot useless goop (some refer to this as gossip) and endless advertisements. I want to live in a world that encourages creative ideas, innovation and authentic self expression. This site is a base for my own self expression (writing) and how I wish to share relevant core messages that enriched my life. I don't have all the answers and I don't want them. I want to feel, question and create. I used to live in this world, which ironically I'm told is the 'real world' -  a world dictated by screens, numbers, money and superficial ideas of happiness. I'm over people and companies that just want to sell, not create out of passion and purpose. Mainstream media, mainstream thoughts and mainstream fear - I think all of it is limiting our real potential here on earth. </p>
            
            <p>So let's not pay attention to it all, it's useless and just distracting. Let's live in the world we want for each other. So... let's change stuff up. Let's question things, learn more and move away from social approval. Each one of us is powerful enough to create great changes... let us just begin with one.”</p>
            
    
            <p>The first stasis is clearly stated in introductory sentence: the fact of the matter and verifiable issue is the distracted mainstream culture of today’s online social media-driven world. This issue is one that is held commonly among social media users. The market-driven advertisement industry is also a significant issue in mainstream culture today as well. She claims that her core intent is to “motivate anyone reading/viewing/listening/watching (you the individual with individual goals and passions and dreams and talents) to be your own game changer.”</p>

            <p>Essena then goes on to paint the picture of a world that “encourages creative ideas, innovation and authentic self expression” and claims that the site is a grounds for her to do so for herself. This statement implicitly suggests that social media and online world of youth culture is what has prevented her from achieving that. However, she continues to insist that she doesn't want her personal convictions (particularly about social media) to be forced upon others. Here, at the second stasis of definition, her argument is clearly stalled; there is no verifiable, exact definition of the problem, and its nature cannot be fully agreed upon, regardless of audience. Therefore, it would seem that her argument cannot move forward to the third stasis of assessing quality. But if we consider Fahnstock and Secor's assertion that a rhetor's attention to a particular stasis reveals details about the intended audience and context, we can further analyze the situation</p>
            
            <p>This consideration and high focus on the nature of the issue at the second stasis reveals Essena's attention to a particular audience: the individuals on social media who recognize the problem, but don't realize the nature of social media's "behind the scenes." Through her blog posts and videos, Essena is trying to explain the nature of the "fakeness" and danger of social media to an audience for whom its definition might be entirely different. This is why she states that for herself, the definition of the problem was her obsession with "likes" and social approval," but that it might be different for the reader. She intends for the context and audience's position to become the basis for individual evaluation of the quality of the issue at hand.</p>   
            
            <p>In this way, though the issue might seem to be stalled at the second stasis, it actually is a keen use of rhetorical questioning that leads the reader to consider action on his or her own definition and policy. Despite the criticism, Essena's message has seen widespread success and response from many people who have connected with its message and found value in it. This was Essena's goal from the start. She effectively achieved what she set out to do by accurately appealing to her intended audience.</p>

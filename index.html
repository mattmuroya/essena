            <p>If you’ve happened to peruse social media in the past several weeks, you may have come across this video. The girl is 19-year-old Essena O’Neill, a (former) self-made social media model and icon. She’d made for herself a considerable career posting photos of herself on Instagram, making videos on YouTube, and posting to Tumblr, Snapchat, and other social media outlets. With over half a million Instagram followers and hundreds of thousands of YouTube views, she’d “made it” according to so-called standards of society.</p>

            <p>But in the fall of 2015, the internet experienced this wave of outspoken, tear-filled, emotional outpourings from Essena, who decided to come clean about her life behind all the photos and social media fame. In a <a href="https://vimeo.com/145100063">the video above</a>, originally posted to YouTube, she decried the “fake” and “dangerous” nature of social media and the negative effect that it’s had on her life and personal well-being. She said:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>"I'm the girl who had it all and I want to tell you that having it all on social media means absolutely nothing to your real life. Everything I was doing was edited and contrived and to get more views ... Everything I did was for views, for likes, for followers."</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>In response to her realization of the alleged detrimental nature of social media, she has publicly denounced all of its forms and has turned her attention to a new online effort:</p>
            <div class="img">
                <img src="assets/images/homescreen.png">
            </div>
            <p><a href="http://www.letsbegamechangers.com">Let’s Be Game Changers</a> is Essena’s new online presence: a blog-style online pulpit where she speaks her new truths.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>“This movement is something so much bigger than myself. What I’m doing here is a statement that real life isn’t through a screen. I’m not against social sharing; I’m against the current status of social media.”</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Clearly, the "campaign" made quite a splash. You can do your own empirical observation: a quick Twitter search for <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23letsbegamechangers">#letsbegamechangers</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23EssenaOneill">#EssenaOneill</a> reveals that more than just a few people have jumped into the conversation. To be fair, while many people have taken her message to heart, others have <a href="http://www.attn.com/stories/4084/essena-oneill-backlash-quitting-social-media">criticized</a> her approach and even <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/11/04/essena-oneill-hoax_n_8474476.html">questioned</a> whether her motives are genuine. Through an objective lens, the criticisms are valid and the conversation is warranted. But, from a rhetorical standpoint, have Essena's new online efforts made an effective appeal to her intended audience? <em>Absolutely</em>.</p>

            <p>When we visit the site, everything is very clean, modern, and minimalistic. The site's choice of a hand-drawn aesthetic (seen in the site's banner) coupled with the writing's informal voice (which includes her disregard for grammatical or syntactic integrity) is actually somewhat refreshing. It's unpolished, unedited, and clearly straight from the drawing board. There's no hiding here; it's all coming from a 19-year-old girl sitting behind a keyboard and pouring out her thoughts. The site's presentation has resonated well with the youthful, casual internet culture it aims to move.</p>
            <div class="img">

            <p>To address the effectiveness of her rhetoric, we must first determine what Essena is actually trying to do and whom she is trying to address. At first pass, especially following the outbreak of her video, one might think that Essena's ultimate purpose is to condemn social media; and I wouldn't fault anyone for that conclusion. But let's look deeper at what Essena has to say:

                <blockquote>
                    <p>My Aim: A friend of mine made this very simple for me at a time I felt a little lost and overwhelmed. It really helped me breathe and realise my life aim isn't at all that big or scary, it's simply this:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Being truly honestly happy and content in the present.</li>
                        <li>Having a positive impact on other people and the world.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>That's it. That's my aim. I don't wish anything more from myself other than to action my values, keep learning, keep being creative and enjoying this crazy ass experience we call life.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>As you can see, Essena's claim extends the scope beyond social media itself. Though her brief stint of internet fame was born of her dramatic social media exit, Essena's prose offers insight into a lifestyle that doesn't stop at cutting digital distratctions. Let's Be Game Changers focuses on several things: "veganism, creative imagery with purpose, poems, writing, interviews with people that inspire me, and of course the finical reality behind deluding people off Instagram” [sic]. So, in addition to a personal blog offering insight into Essena's case in particular, the site offers a collection of various bits of media that she has deemed creative or inspiring:
                    <div class="img">
                        <img src="assets/images/categories.png">
                    </div>
                    <p>We can then examine everything else the site has to offer. Her main collection of media is grouped into several categories (above). There is a section of the site that specifically addressed Essena's struggle with Instagram and social media, in which she has laid bare all that goes into the fake "reality" of social media.</p>
                    <div class="img">
                        <img src="assets/images/insta.jpg">
                    </div>

                    <p>There's a lot going on here, and a lot of it seems to be far-reaching and unspecific. It's difficult to decipher exactly <em>what</em> Essena is addressing in particular. It's conglomeration of differnt topics and ideas, and none of them are specific to any one audience's problems or experiences. Essena even acknowledges that she doesn't "have all the answers", nor does she intend for the site to be a catch-all solution to the problems she's identified with social media culture. She says:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>"I want to live in a world that encourages creative ideas, innovation and authentic self expression. This site is a base for my own self expression (writing) and how I wish to share relevant core messages that enriched my life. I don't have all the answers and I don't want them. I want to feel, question and create."</p>
                    </blockquote>
            <p>We've addressed what the site is, what it says, and what it aims to do. Essena. Thus far, it seems that Essena's claims are far and wide, and yet still the question remains: is it genuine? Does it address a real, tangible issue? Does it effectively persuade its intended audience? To figure it out, let's turn to a bit of rhetorical history.</p>

        </div>
    </section>
    <section class="topic" id="stasis">
        <div class="content">
            <p>In the second century BC, Hermagoras conceived a method of rhetorical categorization of recurrent questions of contention into different stases, now commonly referred to now as Stasis Theory. Originally developed for court of law, Stasis Theory has since been expounded upon in detail by Cicero, Quintillian, and Hermogenes. Application of the stases to matters outside the courtroom has proven to be a particularly valuable probe for audience and context analysis, as demonstrated by Jeanne Fahnstock and Marie Secor (431).</p>

            <p>Stasis Theory outlines four different stases, or “states” of argumentation by which we categorize questions about a particular subject or events. These stases are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Conjecture-</strong> The facts of the matter; whether something veritably happened, whether there is an issue, and in certain cases, the cause of the issue.</li>

                <li><strong>Definition-</strong> The nature of the issue; what the issue is and how it is characterized, and what the larger class of things/events the belongs to is.</li>

                <li><strong>Quality-</strong> The analysis and implication of the issue; whether it is good or bad, how serious it is, whom it might affect, and what the impending reactions to the issue are.</li>

                <li><strong>Policy-</strong> The proposed action to address the issue; what needs to happen to solve the problem.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Stasis Theory is a tiered method of investigation. That is, each state must be fully established before the next may be considered: "Questions of fact or conjecture in the first stasis are prior to those of definition in the second; definitions in turn must be established before the quality is debated; and finally all three must be answered or assumed before an action can be recommended or taken in a specific case” (Fahnstock, Secor 135). So, in order to make a policy claim, the rhetor must first establish the facts, definition, and analysis of the issue.</p>

            <p>However, the effectiveness of a rhetor’s argument often depends heavily on her attention to audience and her understanding of their values within a particular context. In a later article, Fahnstock and Secor reveal that a rhetor might stall in one or two of the stasis and allow the values of the audience and the context of exigence to fill lead the rest of the argument. They write:</p>

            <p>“The great template of the stases hovers above whatever piece of writing we are actually looking at; the stases represent a full set of possibilities from which an author, in a particular rhetorical situation, under a particular exigence, addressing a particular audience, selects. The author may stay in just one or two of the stases because that is where he or she can meet the intended audience, because that is where the audience’s needs and interests lie, or because that is where they can be reached, no matter where the writer wants to take them. In other words, the stases are not only an invention device and a principle of arrangement; they can also become a sensitive tool of audience analysis” (430-431).</p>
            
            <p>This means that the rhetor does not explicitly have to persuade an audience through all four stases of an issue; rather, with an understanding of the intended audience and their values and needs, the rhetor can effectively address an issue and persuade the audience by focusing on a particular stasis and allowing the audience to lead itself to the final stasis of policy.</p>

        </div>
    </section>
    <section class="topic" id="application">
        <div class="content">
            
            <p>The first stasis is clearly stated in Essena's mission: the fact of the matter and verifiable issue is the distracted mainstream culture of today’s online social media-driven world. She explains her issue in detail, and decries the mainstream model of likes, views, and attention on social media. She has identified the problem, its cause, and verified its bearing on people.</p>

            <p>This issue is one that is held commonly among all people everywhere, including social media users. The market-driven advertisement industry is also a significant issue in mainstream culture today as well. She claims that her core intent is to "motivate anyone reading/viewing/listening/watching (you the individual with individual goals and passions and dreams and talents) to be your own game changer."</p>

            <p>Let's Be Game Changers goes beyond this step and encourages a world that makes room for "creative ideas [and] innovation and authentic self expression." This statement implicitly suggests that social media and online world of youth culture is what has prevented her from achieving that. However, she continues to insist that she doesn't want her personal convictions (particularly about social media) to be forced upon others. Here, at the second stasis (definition of a problem), her argument is clearly stalled; there is no verifiable, exact definition of the issue, and its nature cannot be fully agreed upon, regardless of audience. Therefore, it would seem that her argument cannot move forward to the third stasis of assessing quality. But if we consider Fahnstock and Secor's assertion that a rhetor's attention to a particular stasis reveals details about the intended audience and context, we can further analyze the situation</p>

            <p>The high level focus on the nature of the issue at the second stasis reveals Essena's attention to her particular audience: the individuals on social media who recognize the problem, but don't realize the nature of social media's "behind the scenes." Through her blog posts and videos, Essena explains the nature of the "fakeness" and danger of social media to an audience for whom its definition might be entirely different. This is why she states that for herself, the definition of the problem was her obsession with "likes" and social approval," but that it might be different for the reader. She intends for the context and audience's position to become the basis for individual evaluation of the third stasis: quality of the issue at hand.</p>

            <p>In this way, though the issue might seem to be stalled at the second stasis, it actually is a keen use of rhetorical questioning that leads the reader to consider action on his or her own definition and policy. Despite the criticism, Essena's message has seen widespread success and response from many people who have connected with its message and found value in it <em>because it means different things to different people</em>. This was Essena's goal from the start of Let's Be Game Changers. After she was able to rid herself of distraction of social media, she has found her own enlightenment. She encourages others to do the same.</p>
            
            <p>Essena's high attention to the first and second stases on the issue of distracted living speak to her clear understanding of her audience. She knows that not everyone's values and distractions are the same, and that there cannot be any singular definition of the problem. Let's Be Game Changers presents Essena's research and personal experiences on living a fulfilling life in a way that invites her audience to come to their own conclusions about how to evaluate their lives and the actions (policies) they need to take.</p>
            
            <p><em><strong>A personal note that I just wanted to add:</strong> I think the reason a lot of people have brough Essena's movement under such heavy fire is that they don't understand that her goal is not to condemn social media; but rather that <strong>for her</strong>, social media was part of the second stasis, definition, of her problem.</em></p>
